int, long, float, char, bool, enum, struct
stores data value within its own memory space
store data on the stack
allocated memory at the time of declaration
when a value type variable is assigned to another variable or passed as a parameter, a copy of its value is made
non-nullable

reference type
string, class, interface, int[], string[]
stores the address where the value is being stored
store data on the heap
allocated memory at runtime
when a reference type variable is assigned to another variable or passed as a parameter, a copy of its reference is made
nullable



3. What happens when you divide an int variable by 0?
runtime exception of type System.DivideByZeroException



4. What happens when you divide a double variable by 0?
∞
or
-∞
depend on the signs of  the double variable



5. What happens when you overflow an int variable, that is, set it to a value beyond its
range?

No overflow exception for int
the value wraps around to the opposite end of the range
-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647



6. What is the difference between x = y++; and x = ++y;?

x = y++
assigns the value of y to x and then increments y

x = ++y
increments y and then assigns the new value to x



7. What is the difference between break, continue, and return when used inside a loop
statement?

break
Terminates the loop and jumps to the statement following the loop

continue
Skips the current iteration of the loop and jumps to the next iteration.

return
Exits the entire function or method that the loop is contained in, not just the loop itself



8. What are the three parts of a for statement and which of them are required?

Initialization
Condition
Iteration
All three parts are required
